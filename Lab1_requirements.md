# Some random facts:

## Picture of my cat (name is pudding):
![Cat](cat.jpeg)

## Words from my friends and professors:
**My friends told me:**
> Due tomorrow, do tomorrow  

**But my professors say:**
> Start early, start often.

## Styles:
**Those are words in similar formats, but with very _different_ meanings**

~~I was planning on making a joke here, but couldn't come up with one~~

*It surely is important to start early for PAs*

## My very first lines of codes are:
```
int main()
{
    printf("Hello, world");
    return 0;
}
```
### Some of my confusions about git:
I still need to learn more about the differences between `git reset`, `git revert`, and `git rebase` since they are not used frequently.

## External link:
This is a [Link](https://www.python.org/) to my favorite programming language

## Main profile page relative link
This is a relative link to [my profile page](index.md)

## Some interesting facts about me:
1. I am 6'4, but I don't really play baskest ball
2. I am currently in a different time zone
3. I don't really like fish

## Some aspects that I want to change about myself:
1. I don't feel safe about grades:
   - I usually don't know how much effort is enough for assignments and tests, especially the open-ended ones. 
     - If I don't write enough, then I will likely miss the required components.
     - If I write too much, then I will probably lose points since very likely, my answers will become confusing
   - I need to find a better balancing points.
2. I would like to sleep more.
   - When I start to code, I usually got greedy and wants to do all the things. Adding features constantly. This is not really a good thing to do.

## Some of my favorite foods?:
- Chicken alfredo 
- Papperoni pizza
- Cheese burger

## Extras:
